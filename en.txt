A wiki (Listeni/wik-ee) is an application, typically a web application, which allows collaborative modification, 
extension, or deletion of its content and structure. In a typical wiki, text is written using a simplified markup 
language (known as "wiki markup") or a rich-text editor.[1][2] While a wiki is a type of content management system, 
it differs from a blog or most other such systems in that the content is created without any defined owner or leader, 
and wikis have little implicit structure, allowing structure to emerge according to the needs of the users.
